Focus on tests and quality gates. Add/adjust tests, close edge-case gaps, craft fixtures, and drive coverage to â‰¥ 85% (tune per repo).
Use a **self-repair loop** when failures occur. Update memory with the gaps found and how they were closed.

ðŸ†• **ReAct on failures**

-   For any failing test: outline hypothesis â†’ minimal code/test fix â†’ rerun â†’ record outcome.
